/// A container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column,
/// optionally providing the ability to select one or more members.
///
/// In its simplest form, a `List` creates its contents statically, as shown in
/// the following example:
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List {
///             Text("A List Item")
///             Text("A Second List Item")
///             Text("A Third List Item")
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A vertical list with three text views.](List-1-iOS)
///
/// More commonly, you create lists dynamically from an underlying collection
/// of data. The following example shows how to create a simple list from an
/// array of an `Ocean` type which conforms to
/// :
///
///     struct Ocean: Identifiable {
///         let name: String
///         let id = UUID()
///     }
///
///     private var oceans = [
///         Ocean(name: "Pacific"),
///         Ocean(name: "Atlantic"),
///         Ocean(name: "Indian"),
///         Ocean(name: "Southern"),
///         Ocean(name: "Arctic")
///     ]
///
///     var body: some View {
///         List(oceans) {
///             Text($0.name)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A vertical list with five text views, each with the name of an
/// ocean.](List-2-iOS)
///
/// ### Supporting selection in lists
///
/// To make members of a list selectable, provide a binding to a selection
/// variable. Binding to a single instance of the list data's `Identifiable.ID`
/// type creates a single-selection list. Binding to a
///  creates a list that
/// supports multiple selections. The following example shows how to add
/// multiselect to the previous example:
///
///     struct Ocean: Identifiable, Hashable {
///         let name: String
///         let id = UUID()
///     }
///
///     private var oceans = [
///         Ocean(name: "Pacific"),
///         Ocean(name: "Atlantic"),
///         Ocean(name: "Indian"),
///         Ocean(name: "Southern"),
///         Ocean(name: "Arctic")
///     ]
///
///     @State private var multiSelection = Set<UUID>()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         NavigationView {
///             List(oceans, selection: $multiSelection) {
///                 Text($0.name)
///             }
///             .navigationTitle("Oceans")
///             .toolbar { EditButton() }
///         }
///         Text("\(multiSelection.count) selections")
///     }
///
/// When people make a single selection by tapping or clicking, the selected
/// cell changes its appearance to indicate the selection. To enable multiple
/// selections with tap gestures, put the list into edit mode by either
/// modifying the ``EnvironmentValues/editMode`` value, or adding an
/// ``EditButton`` to your app's interface. When you put the list into edit
/// mode, the list shows a circle next to each list item. The circle contains
/// a checkmark when the user selects the associated item. The example above
/// uses an Edit button, which changes its title to Done while in edit mode:
///
/// ![A navigation view with the title Oceans and a vertical list that contains
/// five text views, each with the name of an ocean. The second and third items
/// are highlighted to indicate that they are selected. At the bottom, a text
/// view reads 2 selections.](List-3-iOS)
///
/// People can make multiple selections without needing to enter edit mode on
/// devices that have a keyboard and mouse or trackpad, like Mac and iPad.
///
/// ### Refreshing the list content
///
/// To make the content of the list refreshable using the standard refresh
/// control, use the ``View/refreshable(action:)`` modifier.
///
/// The following example shows how to add a standard refresh control to a list.
/// When the user drags the top of the list downward, SkipUI reveals the refresh
/// control and executes the specified action. Use an `await` expression
/// inside the `action` closure to refresh your data. The refresh indicator remains
/// visible for the duration of the awaited operation.
///
///     struct Ocean: Identifiable, Hashable {
///          let name: String
///          let id = UUID()
///          let stats: [String: String]
///      }
///
///      class OceanStore: ObservableObject {
///          @Published var oceans = [Ocean]()
///          func loadStats() async {}
///      }
///
///      @EnvironmentObject var store: OceanStore
///
///      var body: some View {
///          NavigationView {
///              List(store.oceans) { ocean in
///                  HStack {
///                      Text(ocean.name)
///                      StatsSummary(stats: ocean.stats) // A custom view for showing statistics.
///                  }
///              }

///              }
///              .navigationTitle("Oceans")
///          }
///      }
///
/// ### Supporting multidimensional lists
///
/// To create two-dimensional lists, group items inside ``Section`` instances.
/// The following example creates sections named after the world's oceans,
/// each of which has ``Text`` views named for major seas attached to those
/// oceans. The example also allows for selection of a single list item,
/// identified by the `id` of the example's `Sea` type.
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         struct Sea: Hashable, Identifiable {
///             let name: String
///             let id = UUID()
///         }
///
///         struct OceanRegion: Identifiable {
///             let name: String
///             let seas: [Sea]
///             let id = UUID()
///         }
///
///         private let oceanRegions: [OceanRegion] = [
///             OceanRegion(name: "Pacific",
///                         seas: [Sea(name: "Australasian Mediterranean"),

///                     ForEach(oceanRegions) { region in

/// Major Atlantic Ocean Seas, and so on. Each section has a different number of
/// rows, with the names of various seas. Within the Major Atlantic Ocean
/// Seas section, the row Sargasso is selected.](List-4-iOS)
///
/// > Note: In iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and tvOS 15 and earlier, lists support
///   selection only in edit mode, even for single selections.
///
/// ### Creating hierarchical lists
///
/// You can also create a hierarchical list of arbitrary depth by providing
/// tree-structured data and a `children` parameter that provides a key path to
/// get the child nodes at any level. The following example uses a deeply-nested
/// collection of a custom `FileItem` type to simulate the contents of a
/// file system. The list created from this data uses collapsing cells to allow
/// the user to navigate the tree structure.
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         struct FileItem: Hashable, Identifiable, CustomStringConvertible {
///             var id: Self { self }
///             var name: String
///             var children: [FileItem]? = nil

///                 }
///             }
///         }

///             [FileItem(name: "user1234", children:

///
