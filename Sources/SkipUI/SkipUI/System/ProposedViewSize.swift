/// A proposal for the size of a view.
///
/// During layout in SkipUI, views choose their own size, but they do that
/// in response to a size proposal from their parent view. When you create
/// a custom layout using the ``Layout`` protocol, your layout container
/// participates in this process using `ProposedViewSize` instances.
/// The layout protocol's methods take a proposed size input that you
/// can take into account when arranging views and calculating the size of
/// the composite container. Similarly, your layout proposes a size to each
/// of its own subviews when it measures and places them.
///
/// Layout containers typically measure their subviews by proposing several
/// sizes and looking at the responses. The container can use this information
/// to decide how to allocate space among its subviews. A
/// layout might try the following special proposals:
///
/// * The ``zero`` proposal; the view responds with its minimum size.
/// * The ``infinity`` proposal; the view responds with its maximum size.
/// * The ``unspecified`` proposal; the view responds with its ideal size.
///
/// A layout might also try special cases for one dimension at a time. For
/// example, an ``HStack`` might measure the flexibility of its subviews'
/// widths, while using a fixed value for the height.
