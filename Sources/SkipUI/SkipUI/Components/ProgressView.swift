import struct Foundation.Date
import class Foundation.Progress

/// A view that shows the progress toward completion of a task.
///
/// Use a progress view to show that a task is incomplete but advancing toward
/// completion. A progress view can show both determinate (percentage complete)
/// and indeterminate (progressing or not) types of progress.
///
/// Create a determinate progress view by initializing a `ProgressView` with
/// a binding to a numeric value that indicates the progress, and a `total`
/// value that represents completion of the task. By default, the progress is
/// `0.0` and the total is `1.0`.
///
/// The example below uses the state property `progress` to show progress in
/// a determinate `ProgressView`. The progress view uses its default total of
/// `1.0`, and because `progress` starts with an initial value of `0.5`,
/// the progress view begins half-complete. A "More" button below the progress
/// view allows people to increment the progress in increments of five percent:
///
///     struct LinearProgressDemoView: View {
///         @State private var progress = 0.5
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 ProgressView(value: progress)
///                 Button("More") { progress += 0.05 }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A horizontal barÂ that represents progress, with a More button
/// placed underneath. The progress bar is at 50 percent from the leading
/// edge.](ProgressView-1-macOS)
///
/// To create an indeterminate progress view, use an initializer that doesn't
/// take a progress value:
///
///     var body: some View {
///         ProgressView()
///     }
///
/// ![An indeterminate progress view, presented as a spinning set of gray lines
/// emanating from the center of a circle, with opacity varying from fully
/// opaque to transparent. An animation rotates which line is most opaque,
/// creating the spinning effect.](ProgressView-2-macOS)
///
/// You can also create a progress view that covers a closed range of
///  values. As long
/// as the current date is within the range, the progress view automatically
/// updates, filling or depleting the progress view as it nears the end of the
/// range. The following example shows a five-minute timer whose start time is
/// that of the progress view's initialization:
///
///     struct DateRelativeProgressDemoView: View {
///         let workoutDateRange = Date()...Date().addingTimeInterval(5*60)
///
///         var body: some View {
///              ProgressView(timerInterval: workoutDateRange) {
///                  Text("Workout")
///              }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A horizontal progress view that shows a bar partially filled with as it
/// counts a five-minute duration.](ProgressView-3-macOS)
///
/// ### Styling progress views
///
/// You can customize the appearance and interaction of progress views by
/// creating styles that conform to the ``ProgressViewStyle`` protocol. To set a
/// specific style for all progress view instances within a view, use the
/// ``View/progressViewStyle(_:)`` modifier. In the following example, a custom
/// style adds a rounded pink border to all progress views within the enclosing
/// ``VStack``:
///
///     struct BorderedProgressViews: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 ProgressView(value: 0.25) { Text("25% progress") }
///                 ProgressView(value: 0.75) { Text("75% progress") }
///             }
///             .progressViewStyle(PinkBorderedProgressViewStyle())
///         }
///     }
///
///     struct PinkBorderedProgressViewStyle: ProgressViewStyle {
///         func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
///             ProgressView(configuration)
///                 .padding(4)
///                 .border(.pink, width: 3)
///                 .cornerRadius(4)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![Two horizontal progress views, one at 25 percent complete and the other at 75 percent,
/// each rendered with a rounded pink border.](ProgressView-4-macOS)
///
/// SkipUI provides two built-in progress view styles,
/// ``ProgressViewStyle/linear`` and ``ProgressViewStyle/circular``, as well as
/// an automatic style that defaults to the most appropriate style in the
/// current context. The following example shows a circular progress view that
/// starts at 60 percent completed.
///
///     struct CircularProgressDemoView: View {
///         @State private var progress = 0.6
///
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 ProgressView(value: progress)
///                     .progressViewStyle(.circular)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ![A ring shape, filled to 60 percent completion with a blue
/// tint.](ProgressView-5-macOS)

/// On platforms other than macOS, the circular style may appear as an
/// indeterminate indicator instead.
