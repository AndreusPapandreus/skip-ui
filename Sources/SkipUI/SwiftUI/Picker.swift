/// A control for selecting from a set of mutually exclusive values.
///
/// You create a picker by providing a selection binding, a label, and the
/// content for the picker to display. Set the `selection` parameter to a bound
/// property that provides the value to display as the current selection. Set
/// the label to a view that visually describes the purpose of selecting content
/// in the picker, and then provide the content for the picker to display.
///
/// For example, consider an enumeration of ice cream flavors and a ``State``
/// variable to hold the selected flavor:
///
///     enum Flavor: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///         case chocolate, vanilla, strawberry
///         var id: Self { self }
///     }
///
///     @State private var selectedFlavor: Flavor = .chocolate
///
/// You can create a picker to select among the values by providing a label, a
/// binding to the current selection, and a collection of views for the picker's
/// content. Append a tag to each of these content views using the
/// ``View/tag(_:)`` view modifier so that the type of each selection matches
/// the type of the bound state variable:
///
///     List {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///             Text("Chocolate").tag(Flavor.chocolate)
///             Text("Vanilla").tag(Flavor.vanilla)
///             Text("Strawberry").tag(Flavor.strawberry)
///         }
///     }
///
/// If you provide a string label for the picker, as the example above does,
/// the picker uses it to initialize a ``Text`` view as a
/// label. Alternatively, you can use the ``init(selection:content:label:)``
/// initializer to compose the label from other views. The exact appearance
/// of the picker depends on the context. If you use a picker in a ``List``
/// in iOS, it appears in a row with the label and selected value, and a
/// chevron to indicate that you can tap the row to select a new value:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a list row that has the string Flavor on the left side,
/// and the string Chocolate on the right. The word Chocolate appears in a less
/// prominent color than the word Flavor. A right facing chevron appears to the
/// right of the word Chocolate.](Picker-1-iOS)
///
/// ### Iterating over a pickerâ€™s options
///
/// To provide selection values for the `Picker` without explicitly listing
/// each option, you can create the picker with a ``ForEach``:
///
///     Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///         ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///             Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///         }
///     }
///
/// ``ForEach`` automatically assigns a tag to the selection views using
/// each option's `id`. This is possible because `Flavor` conforms to the
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Identifiable>
/// protocol.
///
/// The example above relies on the fact that `Flavor` defines the type of its
/// `id` parameter to exactly match the selection type. If that's not the case,
/// you need to override the tag. For example, consider a `Topping` type
/// and a suggested topping for each flavor:
///
///     enum Topping: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
///         case nuts, cookies, blueberries
///         var id: Self { self }
///     }
///
///     extension Flavor {
///         var suggestedTopping: Topping {
///             switch self {
///             case .chocolate: return .nuts
///             case .vanilla: return .cookies
///             case .strawberry: return .blueberries
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
///     @State private var suggestedTopping: Topping = .nuts
///
/// The following example shows a picker that's bound to a `Topping` type,
/// while the options are all `Flavor` instances. Each option uses the tag
/// modifier to associate the suggested topping with the flavor it displays:
///
///     List {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $suggestedTopping) {
///             ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///                 Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///                     .tag(flavor.suggestedTopping)
///             }
///         }
///         HStack {
///             Text("Suggested Topping")
///             Spacer()
///             Text(suggestedTopping.rawValue.capitalized)
///                 .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
///         }
///     }
///
/// When the user selects chocolate, the picker sets `suggestedTopping`
/// to the value in the associated tag:
///
/// ![A screenshot of two list rows. The first has the string Flavor on the left
/// side, and the string Chocolate on the right. A right facing chevron appears
/// to the right of the word Chocolate. The second row has the string Suggested
/// Topping on the left, and the string Nuts on the right. Both words on the
/// right use a less prominent color than those on the left.](Picker-2-iOS)
///
/// Other examples of when the views in a picker's ``ForEach`` need an explicit
/// tag modifier include when you:
/// * Select over the cases of an enumeration that conforms to the
///   <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Identifiable> protocol
///   by using anything besides `Self` as the `id` parameter type. For example,
///   a string enumeration might use the case's `rawValue` string as the `id`.
///   That identifier type doesn't match the selection type, which is the type
///   of the enumeration itself.
/// * Use an optional value for the `selection` input parameter. For that to
///   work, you need to explicitly cast the tag modifier's input as
///   <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Optional> to match.
///   For an example of this, see ``View/tag(_:)``.
///
/// ### Styling pickers
///
/// You can customize the appearance and interaction of pickers using
/// styles that conform to the ``PickerStyle`` protocol, like
/// ``PickerStyle/segmented`` or ``PickerStyle/menu``. To set a specific style
/// for all picker instances within a view, use the ``View/pickerStyle(_:)``
/// modifier. The following example applies the ``PickerStyle/segmented``
/// style to two pickers that independently select a flavor and a topping:
///
///     VStack {
///         Picker("Flavor", selection: $selectedFlavor) {
///             ForEach(Flavor.allCases) { flavor in
///                 Text(flavor.rawValue.capitalized)
///             }
///         }
///         Picker("Topping", selection: $selectedTopping) {
///             ForEach(Topping.allCases) { topping in
///                 Text(topping.rawValue.capitalized)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///     .pickerStyle(.segmented)
///
/// ![A screenshot of two segmented controls. The first has segments labeled
/// Chocolate, Vanilla, and Strawberry, with the first of these selected.
/// The second control has segments labeled Nuts, Cookies, and Blueberries,
/// with the second of these selected.](Picker-3-iOS)
