import struct Foundation.URL

/// An action that opens a URL.
///
/// Read the ``EnvironmentValues/openURL`` environment value to get an
/// instance of this structure for a given ``Environment``. Call the
/// instance to open a URL. You call the instance directly because it
/// defines a ``OpenURLAction/callAsFunction(_:)`` method that Swift
/// calls when you call the instance.
///
/// For example, you can open a web site when the user taps a button:
///
///     struct OpenURLExample: View {
///         @Environment(\.openURL) private var openURL
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button {
///                 if let url = URL(string: "https://www.example.com") {
///                     openURL(url)
///                 }
///             } label: {
///                 Label("Get Help", systemImage: "person.fill.questionmark")
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// If you want to know whether the action succeeds, add a completion
/// handler that takes a Boolean value. In this case, Swift implicitly
/// calls the ``OpenURLAction/callAsFunction(_:completion:)`` method
/// instead. That method calls your completion handler after it determines
/// whether it can open the URL, but possibly before it finishes opening
/// the URL. You can add a handler to the example above so that
/// it prints the outcome to the console:
///
///     openURL(url) { accepted in
///         print(accepted ? "Success" : "Failure")
///     }
///
/// The system provides a default open URL action with behavior
/// that depends on the contents of the URL. For example, the default
/// action opens a Universal Link in the associated app if possible,
/// or in the userâ€™s default web browser if not.
///
/// You can also set a custom action using the ``View/environment(_:_:)``
/// view modifier. Any views that read the action from the environment,
/// including the built-in ``Link`` view and ``Text`` views with markdown
/// links, or links in attributed strings, use your action. Initialize an
/// action by calling the ``OpenURLAction/init(handler:)`` initializer with
/// a handler that takes a URL and returns an ``OpenURLAction/Result``:
///
///     Text("Visit [Example Company](https://www.example.com) for details.")
///         .environment(\.openURL, OpenURLAction { url in
///             handleURL(url) // Define this method to take appropriate action.
///             return .handled
///         })
///
/// SkipUI translates the value that your custom action's handler
/// returns into an appropriate Boolean result for the action call.
/// For example, a view that uses the action declared above
/// receives `true` when calling the action, because the

/// An action that initiates a refresh operation.
///
/// When the ``EnvironmentValues/refresh`` environment value contains an
/// instance of this structure, certain built-in views in the corresponding
/// ``Environment`` begin offering a refresh capability. They apply the
/// instance's handler to any refresh operation that the user initiates.
/// By default, the environment value is `nil`, but you can use the
/// ``View/refreshable(action:)`` modifier to create and store a new
/// refresh action that uses the handler that you specify:
///
///     List(mailbox.conversations) { conversation in
///         ConversationCell(conversation)
///     }
///     .refreshable {
///         await mailbox.fetch()
///     }
///
/// On iOS and iPadOS, the ``List`` in the example above offers a
/// pull to refresh gesture because it detects the refresh action. When
/// the user drags the list down and releases, the list calls the action's
/// handler. Because SkipUI declares the handler as asynchronous, it can
/// safely make long-running asynchronous calls, like fetching network data.
///
/// ### Refreshing custom views
///
/// You can also offer refresh capability in your custom views.
/// Read the ``EnvironmentValues/refresh`` environment value to get the
/// `RefreshAction` instance for a given ``Environment``. If you find
/// a non-`nil` value, change your view's appearance or behavior to offer
/// the refresh to the user, and call the instance to conduct the
/// refresh. You can call the refresh instance directly because it defines
/// a ``RefreshAction/callAsFunction()`` method that Swift calls
/// when you call the instance:
///
///     struct RefreshableView: View {
///         @Environment(\.refresh) private var refresh
///
///         var body: some View {
///             Button("Refresh") {
///                 Task {
///                     await refresh?()
///                 }
///             }
///             .disabled(refresh == nil)
///         }
///     }
///
/// Be sure to call the handler asynchronously by preceding it
/// with `await`. Because the call is asynchronous, you can use
/// its lifetime to indicate progress to the user. For example,
/// you might reveal an indeterminate ``ProgressView`` before
/// calling the handler, and hide it when the handler completes.
///
/// If your code isn't already in an asynchronous context, create a
///  for the
/// method to run in. If you do this, consider adding a way for the
/// user to cancel the task. For more information, see
