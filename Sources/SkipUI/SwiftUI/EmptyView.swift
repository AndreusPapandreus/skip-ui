/// You will rarely, if ever, need to create an `EmptyView` directly. Instead,
/// `EmptyView` represents the absence of a view.
///
/// SkipUI uses `EmptyView` in situations where a SkipUI view type defines one
/// or more child views with generic parameters, and allows the child views to
/// be absent. When absent, the child view's type in the generic type parameter
/// is `EmptyView`.
///
/// The following example creates an indeterminate ``ProgressView`` without
/// a label. The ``ProgressView`` type declares two generic parameters,
/// `Label` and `CurrentValueLabel`, for the types used by its subviews.
/// When both subviews are absent, like they are here, the resulting type is
/// `ProgressView<EmptyView, EmptyView>`, as indicated by the example's output:
///
///     let progressView = ProgressView()
///     print("\(type(of:progressView))")
///     // Prints: ProgressView<EmptyView, EmptyView>
